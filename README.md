# Privacy-Comment-Detection

Welcome to the repository for our privacy-comment-detection analysis project!

## Directory Structure

The repository contains the following main directories:

- `crawler_code/` - Contains scripts and programs for data scraping.
- `dataset/` - Stores the final dataset files processed for privacy protection.
- `source_code/` - Contains source code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `wash_data/` - Contains scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Building the Dataset

1. **Data Scraping**

   - Navigate to the `crawler_code/` directory.
   - Read the following readme.txt.
   - Run the appropriate scripts to scrape the required data.
2. **Data Cleaning**

   - Move the scraped data to the `wash_data/` directory.
   - Execute data cleaning scripts to remove unnecessary information, such as duplicates and missing values.
3. **Data Storage**

   - The cleaned data saves in the `dataset/` directory.
   - Based on the principles of privacy protection and ethical review, we have only disclosed the corresponding conversation IDs and features that may be necessary for you in this dataset

## Using the Code

1. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure that all necessary libraries and frameworks are installed. Typically, you can install dependencies via a `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Run the Code**

   - Navigate to the `source_code/` directory.
   - Depending on the task you need to perform, run the corresponding script or program.

### Feature Extraction

In the `source_code/` directory, the code related to feature extraction is located in the `[feature]_extraction/` subdirectory. Here are the steps to use the feature extraction code:

1. **Understand Feature Extraction**

   - Review the `[[feature]_extraction]` to understand how feature extraction works and the methods used.
2. **Run Feature Extraction Scripts**

   - Fill in the corresponding model or data
   - Execute `[[feature]_extraction]` or other related scripts to extract features from the data.
3. **Review the Results**

   - The extracted features will be saved and can be used for subsequent data analysis or machine learning model training.

### Classifier Contrast

The `classifier_contrast/` directory contains scripts and tools for comparing different classification models. It provides an environment to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of various classifiers.
